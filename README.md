# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mourits de Beer

I'm an M.Eng (E&E) graduate with specialization in telecommunications and antenna design. Currently working as a data scientist, big data engineer, and AI engineer. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.

## ðŸš€ My Experience

With academic research I designed a wideband direction finding system for the SKA's precursor project, MeerKAT. I've worked on a variety of projects, including:

- **Life Healthcare**: Statistical analysis of medical items used in their operations
- **Sasol**: Data analysis and forecasting of petrol consumption with neural networks
- **Retail Market Basket Analysis**: Scalable solutions for finding frequent patterns and item associations in very large datasets for Pepkor, The Foschini Group, and Kaap Agri; included weather data correlation
- **XDS Credit Scoring System**: Redesigned a credit scoring system for a leading credit bureau in South Africa, migrating from an outdated SAS and SQL system to a scalable Scala and Spark solution
- **ID Scan**: Full pipeline design including image normalization, OCR, barcode reading, facial recognition, and integration with the Sovrin network for SSI and Verified Credentials; developed liveness check capabilities and advanced computer vision applications using Detectron2, custom Mask-RCNN models and OpenCV

Among others. My main programming languages are **Scala** and **Python**.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm exploring the world of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and DIDComm protocols. In my spare time, I'm working on hobby projects like forecasting cryptocurrency prices.

## ðŸŽ¨ My Interests

I'm a self-ascribed polymath and I value intellectual curiosity and making time for new viewpoints. Primary interests have always been in the abstract world, of mathematics, number theory, the history of philosophy. But, by virtue of popular demand, I've spent as much time learning about physics, quantum electromagnetics, evolutionary psychology, and deep learning. These are a view of my favourite things. To pay the bills, I like to write code that solves big problems. Someone's gotta do it. And, when I'm not working, I like to spend time learning something new, exercising, playing chess or exploring the world around me!

## ðŸ“š Publications

- **Master's Thesis**: *Wideband Direction Finding of RFI for MeerKAT* ([link](https://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/101179))
  - Theoretical design, EM simulations, manufacturing (using 3D-printed technology), and field measurements of a wideband, 4-antenna system for direction finding of electromagnetic interference; to protect MeerKAT / SKA radio-astronomy equipment.
