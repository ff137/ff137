# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mourits de Beer

I'm an M.Eng (E&E) graduate with specialization in telecommunications and antenna design. Currently working as a data scientist, big data engineer, and AI engineer. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.

## ðŸš€ My Experience

I've worked on a variety of projects, including:

- **Life Healthcare**: Statistical analysis of medical items used in their operations
- **Sasol**: Data analysis and forecasting of petrol consumption; designed a neural network in R and later implemented in Java with DeepLearning4J
- **Retail Market Basket Analysis**: Scalable solutions for finding frequent patterns and item associations in large datasets for Pepkor, The Foschini Group, and Kaap Agri; additional analysis with weather data correlation
- **XDS Credit Scoring System**: Redesigned a credit scoring system for a leading credit bureau in South Africa, transitioning from an outdated SAS and SQL system to a scalable Scala and Spark solution
- **ID Scan**: Full pipeline design including image normalization, OCR, barcode reading, facial recognition, and integration with the Sovrin network for SSI and VCs; developed liveness check capabilities and advanced computer vision applications using Detectron2, custom Mask-RCNN models, and OpenCV

Among others. My main programming languages are **Scala** and **Python**.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm exploring the world of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and DIDComm protocols. In my spare time, I'm working on personal projects like forecasting cryptocurrency prices.

## ðŸ“š Publications

- **Master's Thesis**: *Wideband Direction Finding of RFI for MeerKAT* ([link](https://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/101179))
  - Theoretical design, EM simulations, manufacturing (using 3D-printed technology), and field measurements of a wideband, 4-antenna system for direction finding of electromagnetic interference; to protect MeerKAT / SKA radio-astronomy equipment.

## ðŸŽ¨ My Interests

I'm a self-ascribed polymath. Diverse interests in various fields such as mathematics, number theory, physics, biology, astronomy, philosophy, psychology, and everything in between. When I'm not working, I enjoy reading, exercising, listening to music, playing chess, and exploring nature!
