# Hi there! 👋 I'm Mourits de Beer

I'm an M.Eng (E&E) graduate with specialization in telecommunications and antenna design. Experienced as a data scientist, big data engineer, and AI engineer. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.

## 🚀 My Experience

In academia I designed and built a direction finding antenna system intended for the SKA's precursor project, MeerKAT, laying out theory for operating over the very wide bandwidth of the telescopes, to detect and mitigate noise that would interfere with their radioastronomy measurements, using a novel 3D-printed antenna design. That was pretty cool.

Changing gears I then worked professionally on a variety of data science projects, including:

- Life Healthcare: Statistical analysis of medical items used in their operations
- Sasol: Data analysis and forecasting of petrol consumption with neural networks
- Retail Market Basket Analysis: Scalable solutions for finding frequent patterns and item associations in very large datasets for Pepkor, The Foschini Group, and Kaap Agri; included weather data correlation
- XDS Credit Scoring System: Redesigned a credit scoring system for a leading credit bureau in South Africa, migrating from an outdated SAS and SQL system to a scalable Scala and Spark solution
- ID Scan: Full pipeline design including image normalization, OCR, barcode reading, facial recognition, and integration with the Sovrin network for SSI and Verified Credentials; developed liveness check capabilities and advanced computer vision applications using Detectron2, custom Mask-RCNN models and OpenCV

Among many other projects. My main programming languages are **Scala** and **Python**.

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

Exploring the world of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and DIDComm protocols. Hobby projects involve deep learning applied to cryptocurrency forecasting, and predictive modeling for complex data structures.

## 🎨 My Interests

I'm a self-ascribed polymath and I value intellectual curiosity and making time for new viewpoints. Primary interests have always been in the abstract world, of mathematics, number theory, the history of philosophy. But, by virtue of popular demand, I've spent as much time learning about physics, quantum electromagnetics, evolutionary psychology, and deep learning. These are a view of my favourite things. To pay the bills, I like to write code that solves big problems. Someone's gotta do it. And, when I'm not working, I like to spend time learning something new, exercising, playing chess or exploring the world around me!

## 📚 Publications
